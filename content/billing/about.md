      ### Billing Policies

      To ensure transparency and consistency, please review the following billing policies:

      * **All Sales Are Final**:
        Once a service is rendered and payment is processed, all transactions are considered final. We do not offer refunds or exchanges.

      * **Receipts & Invoices**:
        Digital or printed receipts/invoices are available upon request. Please let us know at the time of payment or contact us after your service.

      * **Late Payments**:
        Payment is due upon completion of service unless otherwise arranged. Late payments may be subject to additional fees.

      * **Cancellations & No-Shows**:
        Cancellations must be made in advance. No-show appointments may incur a fee to cover scheduling and operational costs.
